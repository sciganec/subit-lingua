# SUBIT‑Lingua — Design Principles

SUBIT‑Lingua is a minimal, fully regular artificial language built on the structural foundations of SUBIT‑RFC.  
Its design is guided by principles of **clarity**, **regularity**, **isomorphism**, and **structural transparency**.

This document defines the canonical design principles that govern the language.

---

# 1. Minimalism

SUBIT‑Lingua uses the smallest possible set of phonological and morphological elements that can still express the full SUBIT‑64 semantic space.

Minimalism applies at every level:

- **3 consonants** (axes)  
- **4 vowels** (bigrams)  
- **12 syllables**  
- **3 morphological layers**  
- **1 canonical syntax pattern**

Nothing is arbitrary.  
Nothing is decorative.  
Every element is necessary and structurally motivated.

---

# 2. Structural Isomorphism

SUBIT‑Lingua is not inspired by natural languages.  
It is **isomorphic** to SUBIT‑RFC.

This means:

- consonants map to axes  
- vowels map to bigrams  
- syllables map to atomic states  
- trisyllabic forms map to the 64 SUBIT cube states  
- syntax mirrors the WHO → WHERE → WHEN ordering  

The language is a **phonological interface** to the SUBIT structural protocol.

---

# 3. Regularity

SUBIT‑Lingua contains **no irregularities**:

- no exceptions  
- no unpredictable forms  
- no idioms  
- no special cases  
- no morphological drift  

Every word is generated by deterministic rules.  
Every form is decomposable.  
Every meaning is recoverable.

Regularity ensures:

- machine‑readability  
- learnability  
- scalability  
- structural purity  

---

# 4. Transparency

Meaning in SUBIT‑Lingua is **explicitly encoded** in:

- consonant (axis)  
- vowel (bigram)  
- position (role)  
- order (composition)  

There is no hidden semantics.  
There is no metaphorical overload.  
There is no cultural dependency.

Transparency ensures that:

- humans can interpret forms  
- machines can parse them  
- systems can reason over them  

---

# 5. Axis Integrity

The three axes — WHO, WHERE, WHEN — must remain **cleanly separated**.

This is enforced by:

- consonant identity  
- morphological constraints  
- structured form ordering  
- semantic mapping rules  

Axis mixing is allowed only through **compounds**, never within a single root.

This preserves the clarity of the SUBIT coordinate system.

---

# 6. Compositionality

All meaning in SUBIT‑Lingua is **compositional**:

```
Meaning(AB) = Meaning(A) modified by Meaning(B)
```

This applies to:

- roots  
- doubled forms  
- structured forms  
- compounds  
- full expressions  

There is no opaque combination.  
No form loses its internal structure when combined.

---

# 7. Deterministic Morphology

Morphology is strictly combinatorial:

- CV (base root)  
- CV‑CV (doubled root)  
- CV‑CV‑CV (structured form)  

No other morphological shapes exist.

This ensures:

- predictable generation  
- predictable parsing  
- predictable semantics  

---

# 8. Canonical Syntax

SUBIT‑Lingua uses a single canonical clause pattern:

```
WHO WHERE WHEN
```

This ordering reflects:

- subject  
- spatial/structural context  
- temporal/phase context  

Modifiers always follow heads.  
Compounds are left‑to‑right.

Syntax is minimal because the semantics are structural.

---

# 9. Scalability

The language is designed to scale cleanly:

- 12 roots  
- 48 doubled forms  
- 64 structured forms  
- 200‑word core lexicon  
- 512‑word extended lexicon  
- 2048‑word full lexicon  

Scaling never introduces irregularity.  
All expansions follow deterministic rules.

---

# 10. Machine‑Friendliness

SUBIT‑Lingua is designed for:

- parsing  
- generation  
- semantic mapping  
- structural reasoning  
- agent communication  

Features supporting this:

- fixed syllable structure  
- axis‑encoded consonants  
- bigram‑encoded vowels  
- deterministic morphology  
- JSON‑friendly semantics  

---

# 11. Human Learnability

Despite its structural nature, SUBIT‑Lingua is designed to be:

- pronounceable  
- memorable  
- visually clean  
- conceptually intuitive  

The phonology uses globally common sounds.  
The morphology is simple and repetitive.  
The semantics are geometric and consistent.

---

# 12. Aesthetic Coherence

SUBIT‑Lingua follows the aesthetic principles of SUBIT:

- minimal form  
- maximal meaning  
- ideal asymmetry  
- fractal unfolding  
- living tension  

The language is not decorative — it is **structural aesthetics made phonological**.
