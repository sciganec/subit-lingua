# SUBIT‑Lingua — Glossary

This glossary defines the core terms used throughout the SUBIT‑Lingua specification.  
All definitions are structural, minimal, and aligned with SUBIT‑RFC.

---

# A

### **Axis**
One of the three fundamental semantic dimensions of SUBIT‑RFC:
- **WHO** (subject)
- **WHERE** (space/structure)
- **WHEN** (time/phase)

Encoded in SUBIT‑Lingua by consonants **K, T, M**.

### **Atomic Form**
A single CV syllable (base root).  
The smallest meaningful unit in SUBIT‑Lingua.

---

# B

### **Bigram**
A 2‑bit semantic state (00, 01, 10, 11).  
Encoded in SUBIT‑Lingua by vowels **A, E, O, U**.

### **Base Root**
A single CV syllable mapping directly to Axis × Bigram.  
There are 12 base roots.

---

# C

### **Compound**
A sequence of valid morphological units (CV, CV‑CV, CV‑CV‑CV).  
Meaning is compositional and left‑to‑right.

### **Consonant**
One of the three axis markers:
- **K** = WHO  
- **T** = WHERE  
- **M** = WHEN  

---

# D

### **Doubled Root**
A form of the pattern **CV‑CV** where both consonants match.  
Represents refinement or modulation of an axis.  
There are 48 doubled roots.

---

# F

### **Form (Morphological)**
Any valid SUBIT‑Lingua morphological unit:
- base root (CV)  
- doubled root (CV‑CV)  
- structured form (CV‑CV‑CV)

---

# L

### **Lexicon**
The set of all defined SUBIT‑Lingua words.  
Current layers:
- 200‑word Core Lexicon  
- 512‑word Extended Lexicon  
- 2048‑word Roadmap

---

# M

### **Modifier**
A root or doubled form that refines the meaning of a head unit.  
Always appears **after** the head.

### **Morphology**
The combinatorial system that generates:
- 12 base roots  
- 48 doubled roots  
- 64 structured forms  
- all compounds  

### **Multi‑Axis Form**
Any compound combining WHO, WHERE, and WHEN units.

---

# P

### **Phonology**
The minimal sound system of SUBIT‑Lingua:
- 3 consonants (K, T, M)  
- 4 vowels (A, E, O, U)  
- 12 CV syllables  

### **Phrase**
A syntactic sequence of units expressing a structural relation.

---

# R

### **Root**
A base CV syllable.  
The atomic semantic unit.

---

# S

### **Semantic Coordinate**
The SUBIT‑RFC mapping of a form:
- WHO state  
- WHERE state  
- WHEN state  

### **Structured Form**
A trisyllabic form **CV‑CV‑CV** with axis pattern **K–T–M**.  
Represents one of the 64 SUBIT cube states.

### **Syntax**
The minimal ordering rules of SUBIT‑Lingua:
- WHO WHERE WHEN  
- Head + Modifier  
- Left‑to‑right composition  

### **Syllable**
A CV unit (consonant + vowel).  
The only allowed phonological structure.

---

# T

### **Triadic Structure**
The K–T–M ordering of structured forms.  
Encodes subject → space → time.

---

# V

### **Vowel**
One of the four bigram markers:
- **A = 00**  
- **E = 01**  
- **O = 10**  
- **U = 11**

---

# W

### **WHO / WHERE / WHEN**
The three axes of SUBIT‑RFC, encoded by:
- **K** = WHO  
- **T** = WHERE  
- **M** = WHEN
