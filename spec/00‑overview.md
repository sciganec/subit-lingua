# SUBIT‑Lingua: Overview

SUBIT‑Lingua is a minimal, fully regular artificial language built on the structural foundations of SUBIT‑RFC.  
Its purpose is to provide a compact, precise, and universally interpretable interface for describing subjects, processes, and structural relations across human and machine systems.

SUBIT‑Lingua is not a naturalistic language.  
It is a **structural language**, where every phoneme, syllable, and word corresponds directly to coordinates in the SUBIT‑64 architecture.

## 1. Purpose

The language is designed to:

- express SUBIT structures in a phonological and morphological form  
- enable clear, unambiguous communication between humans and AI agents  
- provide a minimal interface for describing subjectivity, processes, and states  
- serve as a foundation for future tools, parsers, generators, and agent protocols  

SUBIT‑Lingua aims to be simple enough to learn quickly, yet expressive enough to model complex systems.

## 2. Structural Foundations

SUBIT‑Lingua inherits its architecture from SUBIT‑RFC:

- **3 axes** → WHO / WHERE / WHEN  
- **4 bigrams** → 00 / 01 / 10 / 11  
- **64 states** → full SUBIT cube  

The language maps these structural elements directly into phonology and morphology.

## 3. Minimal Phonology

SUBIT‑Lingua uses a deliberately small and highly distinct phonological set:

### Consonants (3 axes)
- **K** → WHO (agent / subject)  
- **T** → WHERE (space / structure)  
- **M** → WHEN (time / phase)

### Vowels (4 bigrams)
- **A = 00**  
- **E = 01**  
- **O = 10**  
- **U = 11**

This yields **12 base syllables** (KA, KE, KO, KU, TA, …, MU), forming the phonological crystal of the language.

---

## 4. Morphological System

The morphology is fully regular and layered:

- **12 base roots**  
- **48 doubled roots**  
- **64 structured trisyllabic forms** (mapping the SUBIT cube)  
- **200+ core lexicon entries**  
- scalable to **512**, **2048**, and beyond  

Every word is structurally interpretable and directly corresponds to SUBIT coordinates.

---

## 5. Syntax

SUBIT‑Lingua uses a minimal compositional syntax:

- **[WHO] [WHERE] [WHEN]** as the canonical clause pattern  
- modifiers formed through doubling or structured trisyllabic forms  
- no irregularities, exceptions, or idioms  

The syntax is designed for clarity, precision, and machine‑readability.

---

## 6. Design Principles

SUBIT‑Lingua follows these principles:

- **Minimalism** — smallest possible phonological and morphological set  
- **Regularity** — no exceptions or irregular forms  
- **Isomorphism** — direct mapping to SUBIT‑RFC  
- **Transparency** — every word is structurally interpretable  
- **Scalability** — lexicon and syntax expand without breaking the system
