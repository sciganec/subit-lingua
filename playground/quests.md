# SUBIT‑Lingua Playground — Quests

Quests are long‑form explorations designed to immerse you in the structural
logic of SUBIT‑Lingua. Each quest unfolds through multiple steps, revealing
patterns, tensions, and emergent meaning.

There are no correct answers.  
Only coherence, geometry, and discovery.

# Quest 1 — Build a Structural Being

Goal: construct a coherent 4‑unit compound that expresses a “being” in SUBIT terms.

### Step 1 — Choose a core
Pick one structured form that feels like the center of this being.

### Step 2 — Add a spatial modulation
Choose a doubled form from the T‑axis that modifies the core.

### Step 3 — Add a temporal modulation
Choose a doubled form from the M‑axis that shifts the phase.

### Step 4 — Add a release or closure
Choose any form that completes the being’s cycle.

### Step 5 — Interpret the whole
Describe the being’s:
- identity  
- structure  
- temporal behavior  
- overall personality

# Quest 2 — Map a Process

Goal: express a real‑world process as a SUBIT compound.

### Step 1 — Pick a process
Examples: growth, decay, learning, conflict, healing.

### Step 2 — Identify four phases
Map them to:
- emergence  
- form  
- depth  
- energy  

### Step 3 — Assign forms
Choose one structured form for each phase.

### Step 4 — Compose the chain
Arrange them left‑to‑right.

### Step 5 — Analyze the flow
Explain how the chain expresses the process structurally.

# Quest 3 — Explore a Cube Path

Goal: walk a path through the 64‑state SUBIT cube.

### Step 1 — Choose a starting point
Pick any structured form.

### Step 2 — Move through the cube
Make 5 moves.  
Each move must change exactly one vowel.

### Step 3 — Record the path
Write the 6 forms in sequence.

### Step 4 — Interpret the journey
Describe:
- what changed  
- what stayed stable  
- what the path expresses

# Quest 4 — Construct a Field

Goal: create a multi‑unit field that expresses a complex system.

### Step 1 — Choose a domain
Examples: ecosystem, team, machine, ritual, cycle.

### Step 2 — Identify 5 components
Map them to:
- subject  
- structure  
- time  
- modulation  
- release  

### Step 3 — Assign forms
Choose one form for each component.

### Step 4 — Compose the field
Arrange them into a 5‑unit compound.

### Step 5 — Interpret the field
Explain how the units interact.

---

# Quest 5 — Invert a Narrative

Goal: take a compound and invert its meaning structurally.

### Step 1 — Create a 3‑unit compound
Any domain, any forms.

### Step 2 — Invert bigrams
A↔U, E↔O for all units.

### Step 3 — Invert axes
K→T→M→K for all units.

### Step 4 — Reverse the order
Unit3 → Unit2 → Unit1.

### Step 5 — Compare narratives
Describe:
- original meaning  
- inverted meaning  
- structural tension  

---

# Quest 6 — Design a Ritual

Goal: express a cyclical ritual using SUBIT‑Lingua.

### Step 1 — Define the cycle
Choose 4 phases of the ritual.

### Step 2 — Assign structured forms
One for each phase.

### Step 3 — Add transitions
Insert doubled forms between phases.

### Step 4 — Compose the ritual
You should have 7–8 units.

### Step 5 — Interpret the ritual
Describe the cycle and its internal logic.

---

# Quest 7 — Create a SUBIT Creature

Goal: invent a creature whose “biology” is expressed through SUBIT forms.

### Step 1 — Define its core
Pick one structured form as its essence.

### Step 2 — Define its movement
Choose a 3‑step bigram flow.

### Step 3 — Define its behavior
Choose a doubled form that expresses its temperament.

### Step 4 — Define its life cycle
Choose 4 structured forms that express:
- birth  
- growth  
- peak  
- dissolution  

### Step 5 — Describe the creature
Write a structural biography.

---

# Quest 8 — Build a SUBIT Language

Goal: use SUBIT‑Lingua to encode a small semantic domain.

### Step 1 — Choose a domain
Examples: emotions, weather, actions, states.

### Step 2 — Pick 4–6 concepts
Map each to a structured form.

### Step 3 — Create modifiers
Choose doubled forms that modify meaning.

### Step 4 — Create expressions
Combine forms into 2–3 unit compounds.

### Step 5 — Document the mini‑language
Write a small lexicon + examples.

---

# Quest 9 — The Spiral

Goal: create a spiral flow using both axis and bigram rotations.

### Step 1 — Choose a starting form
Any structured form.

### Step 2 — Apply bigram rotation
A→E→O→U→A.

### Step 3 — Apply axis rotation
K→T→M→K.

### Step 4 — Repeat 4 times
You should have a 5‑unit spiral.

### Step 5 — Interpret the spiral
Describe the transformation.

---

# Quest 10 — The Impossible Structure

Goal: define a structure that cannot exist in SUBIT‑Lingua.

### Step 1 — Propose a form
Invent something that violates:
- axis integrity  
- bigram mapping  
- morphology  
- syntax  

### Step 2 — Explain the violation
Which rule does it break?

### Step 3 — Create a corrected version
Fix the structure using canonical rules.

### Step 4 — Compare
Describe the difference between impossible and possible.
