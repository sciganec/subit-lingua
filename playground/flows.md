# SUBIT‑Lingua Playground — Structural Flows

SUBIT‑Lingua is not only a set of forms — it is a field of flows.  
Every axis, bigram, and composition participates in four fundamental movements:

1. Emergence  
2. Form  
3. Depth  
4. Energy  

These flows appear in:
- atomic forms  
- doubled forms  
- structured forms  
- compounds  
- transformations  

This module explores these flows as living dynamics.

# 1. Bigram Flow (A → E → O → U)

The simplest and most universal flow in SUBIT‑Lingua is the bigram cycle:

```
A → E → O → U → A
```

Meaning:
- **A** — emptiness, beginning  
- **E** — boundary, form  
- **O** — depth, source  
- **U** — energy, culmination  

### Exercise
Pick any consonant (K/T/M).  
Cycle the vowels.  
Observe how the axis “breathes” through the flow.

---

# 2. Axis Flow (K → T → M → K)

The second fundamental flow is the axis cycle:

```
WHO → WHERE → WHEN → WHO
```

Meaning:
- **K** — subject  
- **T** — structure  
- **M** — time  
- back to subject  

### Exercise
Pick any vowel.  
Rotate the consonants.  
Observe how the same bigram behaves across axes.

---

# 3. Doubled‑Form Flow (CV‑CV)

Doubled forms encode **internal modulation** within one axis.

Example (WHEN axis):
```
MA‑ME → ME‑MO → MO‑MU → MU‑MA
```

Meaning:
- beginning → rhythm → depth → energy → beginning  

### Pattern
Every axis has a 4‑step flow:
```
00 → 01 → 10 → 11 → 00
```

### Exercise
Pick any axis.  
Write the full 16 doubled forms.  
Trace the 4‑step flow through them.

---

# 4. Structured Flow (CV‑CV‑CV)

Structured forms express flows across **all three axes** simultaneously.

Example:
```
KA‑TE‑MA → KE‑TE‑ME → KO‑TE‑MO → KU‑TE‑MU
```

This is a **pure bigram flow** with WHERE locked.

Meaning:
- subject emergence  
- subject form  
- subject depth  
- subject energy  

### Exercise
Lock one axis.  
Flow the other two.  
Observe the geometry.

---

# 5. Compound Flow (Chains)

Compounds express **processes**.

A canonical 4‑unit flow:

```
KA‑TA‑MA → KE‑TE‑ME → KO‑TO‑MO → KU‑TU‑MU
```

Meaning:
- emergence  
- form  
- depth  
- energy  

This is the “pure diagonal” of the SUBIT cube.

### Exercise
Create your own 4‑unit flow.  
Interpret the process.

---

# 6. Mixed Flows

Flows can combine:

### 6.1 Axis Flow + Bigram Flow
Rotate consonants and vowels simultaneously.

Example:
```
KA → TE → MO → KU
```

### 6.2 Doubled Flow + Structured Flow
Take a doubled form.  
Embed it inside a structured form.

Example:
```
(KE‑KO) inside KA‑TE‑MO
```

### 6.3 Compound Flow + Axis Flow
Rotate the head of a compound.

Example:
```
KA‑TE‑ME → TA‑TE‑ME → MA‑TE‑ME
```

### Exercise
Pick any form.  
Apply two flows at once.  
Observe the emergent pattern.

# 7. Flow Archetypes

These are canonical flow types in SUBIT‑Lingua.

### 7.1 Expansion Flow
A → E → O → U  
Meaning: unfolding, growth, intensification.

### 7.2 Contraction Flow
U → O → E → A  
Meaning: collapse, return, dissolution.

### 7.3 Spiral Flow
Axis rotation + bigram rotation.  
Meaning: transformation through cycles.

### 7.4 Pulse Flow
00 → 11 → 00  
Meaning: burst, release, reset.

### Exercise
Identify which flow a given compound expresses.

# 8. Create Your Own Flow

### Prompts
- emergence → form → depth → energy  
- identity → structure → modulation → release  
- beginning → rhythm → depth → peak  
- emptiness → boundary → source → culmination
