# SUBIT‑Lingua Playground — Exercises

These exercises are designed to build intuition for SUBIT‑Lingua through direct
interaction with forms. They follow a progression from atomic perception to
structured composition and transformation.

There are no right answers.  
Only structure, observation, and emergence.

# 1. Atomic Forms (CV)

### Exercise 1.1 — Axis Recognition
Say each form aloud:
KA, KE, KO, KU  
TA, TE, TO, TU  
MA, ME, MO, MU

Identify:
- Which axis feels like subject?
- Which feels like space?
- Which feels like time?

### Exercise 1.2 — Bigram Cycle
Hold the consonant constant.  
Cycle the vowels A → E → O → U.

Observe:
- How does the state shift?
- Which transitions feel smooth? Sharp?

### Exercise 1.3 — Axis Shift
Pick any vowel.  
Shift consonants K → T → M → K.

Observe:
- How the same bigram behaves across axes.

# 2. Doubled Forms (CV‑CV)

### Exercise 2.1 — Full Axis Grid
Choose one axis (K, T, or M).  
Generate all 16 doubled forms (4×4).

Example for K-axis:
KA‑KA, KA‑KE, KA‑KO, KA‑KU  
KE‑KA, KE‑KE, KE‑KO, KE‑KU  
...

Observe:
- Which pairs feel stable?
- Which feel directional?

### Exercise 2.2 — Diagonal Stability
Take the diagonal:
A→A, E→E, O→O, U→U.

Interpret:
- What does “same→same” feel like on this axis?

### Exercise 2.3 — Peak Modulation
Take the U‑row (x→U).  
Take the U‑column (U→x).

Compare:
- Rising into U  
- Falling out of U

# 3. Structured Forms (CV‑CV‑CV)

### Exercise 3.1 — Cube Slice
Fix the first vowel (WHO).  
Vary the other two.

Example:
KA‑TA‑MA  
KA‑TE‑ME  
KA‑TO‑MO  
KA‑TU‑MU

Observe:
- How the subject changes as space/time shift.

### Exercise 3.2 — Axis Lock
Fix the second vowel (WHERE).  
Vary WHO and WHEN.

Interpret:
- What does a stable spatial state feel like?

### Exercise 3.3 — Full Diagonal
Choose one vowel (A/E/O/U).  
Use it for all three axes.

Examples:
KA‑TA‑MA  
KE‑TE‑ME  
KO‑TO‑MO  
KU‑TU‑MU

Observe:
- The “pure bigram” personality.

# 4. Compounds

### Exercise 4.1 — Two‑Unit Chain
Pick any structured form.  
Add a doubled form after it.

Example:
KA‑TE‑MU TA‑ME

Interpret:
- How does the second unit modulate the first?

### Exercise 4.2 — Three‑Unit Process
Create a chain of three units:
Unit1 → Unit2 → Unit3

Interpret:
- What process emerges?

### Exercise 4.3 — Head Shift
Take your chain.  
Move the last unit to the front.

Compare:
- How does the meaning shift when the head changes?

---

# 5. Transformations

### Exercise 5.1 — Axis Rotation
Take any form.  
Rotate consonants:
K→T, T→M, M→K.

Observe:
- How the same bigram behaves across axes.

### Exercise 5.2 — Bigram Rotation
Rotate vowels:
A→E→O→U→A.

Observe:
- How the same axis behaves across bigrams.

### Exercise 5.3 — Position Rotation
Take a compound of 3 units.  
Rotate their order.

Interpret:
- How does the narrative change?

# 6. Perception & Intuition

### Exercise 6.1 — Emergence
Find a form that feels like:
- beginning
- opening
- appearance

### Exercise 6.2 — Stability
Find a form that feels:
- centered
- balanced
- steady

### Exercise 6.3 — Transition
Find a form that feels:
- shifting
- moving
- transforming

### Exercise 6.4 — Peak
Find a form that feels:
- intense
- culminating
- bursting

---

# 7. Creation

### Exercise 7.1 — Describe a State
Pick any structured form.  
Write a one‑sentence structural interpretation.

### Exercise 7.2 — Describe a Process
Pick any 3‑unit compound.  
Describe the process it encodes.

### Exercise 7.3 — Invent a Pattern
Create a 4‑unit chain that expresses:
- emergence → form → depth → energy
