# SUBIT‑Lingua Playground

The SUBIT‑Lingua Playground is an interactive space for learning, exploring, and 
experimenting with the structural language of SUBIT. It is designed for direct 
experience: pressing forms, combining units, observing patterns, and discovering 
the geometry of meaning.

This is not a tutorial.  
This is a field.

# 1. Start: Atomic Forms (CV)

Choose any of the 12 atomic forms and observe how they feel:

WHO (K): KA, KE, KO, KU  
WHERE (T): TA, TE, TO, TU  
WHEN (M): MA, ME, MO, MU

**Exercise:**  
Say each form aloud.  
Notice how the vowel shifts the axis state.

---

# 2. Doubled Forms (CV‑CV)

Doubled forms show modulation inside one axis.

Examples:
- KA‑KE  
- TE‑TO  
- MO‑MU  

**Exercise:**  
Pick any axis.  
Generate all 4×4 combinations.  
Observe how A→E→O→U behaves as a cycle.

---

# 3. Structured Forms (CV‑CV‑CV)

These are the 64 SUBIT cube states.

Pattern:
```
K Vx – T Vy – M Vz
```

Examples:
- KA‑TE‑MA  
- KE‑TO‑ME  
- KO‑TU‑MO  
- KU‑TA‑MU  

**Exercise:**  
Pick any vowel (A/E/O/U).  
Hold it constant across all three axes.  
Observe the “diagonal” of the cube.

---

# 4. Combine Units (Compounds)

Compounds are left‑to‑right compositions.

Examples:
- KA‑TE‑MU TA‑ME  
- MA‑ME KA  
- KO‑TE‑MU MO‑MU  

**Exercise:**  
Create a 3‑unit chain.  
Interpret it structurally (not lexically).

---

# 5. Transformations

Try these transformations:

### 5.1 Axis Shift
Replace K→T→M→K while keeping vowels.

### 5.2 Bigram Shift
A→E→O→U→A while keeping consonants.

### 5.3 Position Shift
Rotate units inside a compound.

**Exercise:**  
Pick any form.  
Apply all three transformations.  
Observe the geometry.

---

# 6. Mini‑Challenges

### Challenge 1  
Create a form that feels like “emergence”.

### Challenge 2  
Create a compound that expresses “transition”.

### Challenge 3  
Find a structured form that feels like “stability”.

### Challenge 4  
Invent a 4‑unit chain that describes a process.

---

# 7. Open Field

There is no right or wrong here.  
SUBIT‑Lingua is structural, not lexical.  
Meaning emerges from:

- axis  
- bigram  
- position  
- composition  

Play with them.  
Observe.  
Discover.
